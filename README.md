## Project Overview

This project investigates the capabilities of state-of-the-art NLP models such as RoBERTa, BanglaBERT, and BERT Base for evaluating Bangla passage-based question-answering from the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) textbooks for classes 6-10. The main goal is to develop a machine learning-based system capable of assessing Bangla text comprehension in educational settings.

## Features

- **Dataset**: A curated dataset of around 3,000 passage-based question-answer pairs from NCTB textbooks (Classes 6-10).
- **Models Used**: 
  - RoBERTa
  - BanglaBERT
  - BERT Base
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - F1 Score
  - Exact Match (EM) Score

## Dataset

The dataset consists of approximately 3,000 question-answer pairs extracted from textbooks published by NCTB. Each passage provides context for related questions. The dataset was curated by human annotators and is divided into training and validation sets (70%-30% split).

- **File Format**: CSV
- **Contents**:
  - Passage Text
  - Corresponding Questions
  - Human-annotated Answers
